# Every Day Giardiniera

> I was heavily inspired by Mike over at Chilli Madness with his article [here](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-recipes/hot-sauces/homemade-chicago-style-giardiniera/). 

## My Take 

Makes an average of 3 Quart Jars to be used in the fridge and used daily in and on everything! 

### Ingredients

- 6 Jalapenos Peppers
- 6 Fingerhot Peppers
- 1 Red Bell Pepper
- 8oz of Carrot Sticks
- 8oz of Celery Sticks
- 1 large Vidalia Onion
- 1/2 Head cauliflower
- 3 cups of White Vinegar
- 3 cups of Pure Canola Oil
- 3 Tablespoons of Oregano
- 6 Teaspoons of black pepper
- 3 Teaspoons of minced garlic
- 1/2 cup of salt

### Substitutions

You can substitute Serrano Peppers for the Fingerhots.
You can substitute any type of sweet pepper for the Red Bell Pepper.

## Steps

### Brine

1. Chop up in bite size pieces all of the peppers, cauliflower, carrots, celery and the onion and place in large bowl.
2. Add Salt to over the veggies
3. Cover with water and stir.
4. Cover bowl with lid or some wrap and place in fridge for 24 hours.

### Process Mix

1. Rinse veggies in bowl.
2. Add veggies to a Quart Jar - I use Ball canning jars
3. In another mixing bowl, add 1 cup of white vinegar and add 1 tablespoon of dried oregano and 2 teaspoons of black pepper and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic to bowl then whisk in 1 cup of pure canola oil to make a vinegrette.
4. Pour vinegrette into the jar over the veggies.
5. Lid up the jar and give quick shake to the jar.
6. Place jar in Fridge and repeat for the next Jar.

## Ideas

- Use veggies as-is on a plate as an anti-pasta salad.
- Mix with some Ramen or your favorite type of noodle and make a pasta salad.
- Put on sammiches for a tangy, crunchy voyage into heavan.
- Add to any leftover to brighten it up.
